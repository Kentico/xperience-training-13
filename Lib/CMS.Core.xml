            A loop in application core pre-initialization is typically caused by some module's pre-initialization code trying to perform actions which require the application core to be
            already pre-initialized. Module's pre-initialization must never rely on such actions.

            <remarks>
            Since version 11 the attribute no longer registers implementation within <see cref="T:CMS.Core.ObjectFactory`1"/>. To register an implementation within object factory,
            use <see cref="M:CMS.Core.ObjectFactory`1.SetObjectTypeTo``1(System.Boolean,System.Boolean)"/>.

            <remarks>
            The order of registrations is determined by the order in which modules (assemblies) are initialized. The order respects assemblies' references.
            There is no guarantee on order within an assembly.
